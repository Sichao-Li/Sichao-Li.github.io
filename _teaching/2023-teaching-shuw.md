Objective
===
This visit aimed to strengthen the existing partnership with SDUW and deliver a pre-departure session for students arriving at ANU in Semester 2, 2024. 

Responsibilities
===
As part of an international academic collaboration, I served as an International Teaching Fellow at the ANU partner 
institution, SDUW in China, in November 2023. In this role, I independently redesigned and 
implemented the curriculum and assessment materials for the Data Structures course. Over the course of the semester, I 
delivered a comprehensive series of 24 lectures to approximately 150 undergraduate students, complemented by rigorous 
assessments. I appreciate the help from Prof. Jiang Bin at SHUW in making all the delivery smoother.
