Responsibilities
======
I have been actively involving in various teaching, support of learning activities and supervising since 2019. I led labs and tutorials for groups of 20~40 undergraduate and 
postgraduate students in various computing courses, including *Foundations of Computing*, *Introduction to Database 
Concepts*, *Relational Database*, and *Computer Vision*. 

In these sessions, which typically ran for two hours, I delivered
instructions on specific topics/skills and addressed course-related inquiries from students. I am currently tutoring Relational 
Database course. After the first two years of tutoring experience, I provided guidance to new tutors at the start of their 
tutorials and assisted course conveners in developing lab materials and crafting assignments and final exams.
