Hi there! My name is Sichao, a Ph.D. Student at Australian National University(ANU). I am currently supervised by [Prof. Amanda Barnard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Barnard) and co-supervised by [Dr. Quanling Deng](https://quanlingdeng.github.io/) and [Dr. Amanda Parker](https://comp.anu.edu.au/people/amanda-parker/). I obtained my M.C.S. from ANU in 2020, under the supervision of [Dr. Charles Martain](https://charlesmartin.au/) and I was working as a research assistant under the supervision of [Prof. Steve Blackburn](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~steveb/). My B.S.M.E. was received from Shanghai Ocean University(SHOU) in 2018. 

I will be always in the fond memory of our dear supervisor -- [Dr. Yu Lin](https://www.forevermissed.com/yulin/about) (1981/11 - 2022/10).
